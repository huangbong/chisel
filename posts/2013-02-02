Installing SiriProxy on a Raspberry Pi

I'm going to be testing out SiriProxy running on the low-powered Raspberry Pi. But before I do all of that, I need to get it setup first. Here are the steps to install SiriProxy on Rasbian Wheezy (2012-12-16).

Here's my uname -a output for reference.
```Linux raspberrypi 3.2.27+ #250 PREEMPT Thu Oct 18 19:03:02 BST 2012 armv6l GNU/Linux```

1. SSH and login to your Raspberry pi as the user "pi" or any other non-root user.
```ssh pi@your.ip.address.yolo```

2. Update your system.
```sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade```

3. Install some dependencies.
```sudo apt-get install dnsmasq ruby build-essential openssl libreadline6 libreadline6-dev curl git-core zlib1g zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt-dev autoconf libc6-dev ncurses-dev automake libtool bison subversion```

4. Edit /etc/dnsmasq.conf
```sudo vi /etc/dnsmasq.conf
# add the following to the config:
# address=/guzzoni.apple.com/your.pi.ip.address```

5. Install RVM
```curl -L https://get.rvm.io > rvm.sh
chmod +x rvm.sh
./rvm.sh```

6. Activate RVM
```[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && . "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"```

7. Add RVM to your .bash_profile
```vi ~/.bash_profile```
Add to following to the bottom
```[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" # Load RVM into a shell session *as a function*
[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && . "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" # Load RVM function```

8. Install Ruby 1.9.3 
* This will take a LONG time to compile and install. You should run it in a screen.
```rvm install 1.9.3```
