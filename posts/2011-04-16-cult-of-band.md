![Marching band states competition picture.](http://i.huang.mx/i/672es.jpg)

There are 2 main requirements to join the cult:

1. Be in AT LEAST 1 band class.
2. Participate in Marching band.

After being accepted into the band, one will start getting into the habit of 
doing various things:

* Eating lunch in the band room
* Playing your instrument in the band room at lunch
* Eating and playing your instrument in the band room at lunch at the same time
* Talking about marching band and the song
* Talking about festival
* Talking about band music, band, instruments, etc. 24/7
* Setting your profile picture on Facebook to either your instrument or a 
picture of you with your instrument

There are several stages or "phases" in the band cult:

1. Newcomer to the cult, usually a freshmen. Not extremely known but tries to 
get people to like him/her.
2. Knows everyone and is friends with most band cult members.
3. Gets respect and praise from the other band cult members to further the 
circlejerk.
4. Aquire leadership position(s) in marching band or regular band class. Now 
part of the band cult "leaders".
5. Major position such as drum major for marching band and his/her followers.

*Note that phase 5 is very limited to the most elite people of the cult.

So to sum this all up, the band cult is just like the football team. They all 
support each other and do absolutely nothing else.
